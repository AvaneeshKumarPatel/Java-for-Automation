Java Learning Roadmap for Automation Testing


âœ… Stage 1: Java Basics
These are foundational concepts every tester needs.

ğŸ”¹ Java Syntax & Structure

ğŸ”¹ Data Types & Variables   

ğŸ”¹ Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical)

ğŸ”¹ Control Statements:

if, else if, switch

Loops: for, while, do-while

âœ… Stage 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Core for writing structured, reusable automation scripts.

ğŸ”¹ Classes & Objects

ğŸ”¹ Constructors

ğŸ”¹ this keyword

ğŸ”¹ Inheritance (extends)

ğŸ”¹ Polymorphism (method overloading & overriding)

ğŸ”¹ Encapsulation (getters/setters, private fields)

ğŸ”¹ Abstraction (abstract classes & interfaces)


âœ… Stage 3: Methods & Modifiers
Learn how to define and use reusable logic.


ğŸ”¹ Method declaration and overloading

ğŸ”¹ Static vs Non-static

ğŸ”¹ Access Modifiers: public, private, protected, default

ğŸ”¹ Final keyword


âœ… Stage 4: Java Collections & Data Handling
Used heavily in test data management.

ğŸ”¹ Arrays

ğŸ”¹ Collections Framework:

ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap

ğŸ”¹ Iterating collections (for-each loop, Iterator)

ğŸ”¹ Generics

ğŸ”¹ Sorting and searching with Collections utility class


âœ… Stage 5: Exception Handling
Helps manage script failures gracefully.

ğŸ”¹ Try-catch-finally blocks

ğŸ”¹ Multiple catch blocks

ğŸ”¹ throws and throw keywords

ğŸ”¹ Custom exceptions

 
âœ… Stage 6: File Handling
Used for reading test data (like Excel, config files).

ğŸ”¹ Reading and writing files using File, FileReader, BufferedReader, etc.

ğŸ”¹ Working with Properties files

ğŸ”¹ Intro to external libraries (e.g., Apache POI â€“ optional later)


âœ… Stage 7: Useful Java APIs & Libraries
Common for automation scripting.

ğŸ”¹ String & StringBuilder

ğŸ”¹ Math and Random

ğŸ”¹ Date and Time APIs (Java 8+: LocalDate, LocalTime)

ğŸ”¹ System class and environment variables

âœ… Stage 8: Java 8+ Features (Optional but Useful)
Useful in modern frameworks.

ğŸ”¹ Lambda expressions

ğŸ”¹ Streams API

ğŸ”¹ Functional interfaces

ğŸ”¹ Method references

âœ… Stage 9: Practical Java Setup
ğŸ”¹ Set up JDK

ğŸ”¹ Use an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse)

ğŸ”¹ Write, compile, and run Java programs

ğŸ”¹ Understand .class and .java files
